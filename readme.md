# LA Map d3

This repo accomplishes three things:

1. represents every tract in Los Angeles as part of a d3-generated svg map
2. transforms LA homeless count data into a json form that is processable by d3
3. combines the two datasets onto a visualization that makes the homeless count appear like stars in the night sky.

Why represent this data to be analogous to stars? Well, staring into the night sky and watching the stars gives the feeling of largeness and endlessness. Also, outer space feels like a realm in which only science and technology can tackle, which is the same appeal I'm hoping to represent here. And lastly, each tract represents its own unique galaxy and ecosystem, and in that way the pairing between LA and outer space just felt right to me.

This project is developed as part of the branding effort for Hack SC.
